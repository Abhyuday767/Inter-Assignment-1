Part 1: Debugging
Bugs Identified and Fixes:


Syntax Error:
In fetchUsers function, setTimout should be setTimeout.
Fix: Corrected the spelling to setTimeout.


Logical Error:
In the displayUsers function, userListDiv is selected with #userList, but the HTML uses usersList.
Fix: Changed #userList to #usersList to match the HTML.

The callback function in fetchUsers is receiving user, but it should be users.
Fix: Changed (user) to (users) in the callback function.
